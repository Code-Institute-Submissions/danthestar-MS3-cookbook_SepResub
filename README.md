## UX
---
---
### **Idea**
    In the beginning i wasn't sure what, how or where to start: since code it self was so overwelming and still for me so hard to be abe to produce purly somehting on my own.

    after retrying for 2 time the same taks, i decided to go with mini project = and folowing step by step, changing only stayling of it. the main core is the same as in mini project|Puting It All Togheter.

    So since my entire reason to start doing coding was to be able to start doing in game   development or application development, i understand know that i need allot of practice in order to master all of the interactions: JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB, Heroku + CRUD functionality.
 
**But since this is my first MS3**, and it way more complicated and needs way more focus i needed a model that i can follow and understand, so thats way i decided to go with mini project|Puting It All Togheter as example.
      
    I try my best to not use same names as the source of my code, so by doing that i hope i avoid at least some of related issues confronting forms about violation of use Plagiarism Policy.

    Satying that i was still not being able to digress far form core code = it so many tiny options to make a mistake or simply typo mistakes and code isnt working again. 
## Owner goals
---
#### Goal was to build simple task managment for biger and more active families
* To increase the number of participants in MMM's daily tasking by providing 
  a simple, easy to use application.
* By doing that it easier to see biger picture, of immportance to each member
* Make easier day to day's taks in evrydays life of grown ups.
* Better control of your own time and all the task that we all need to perform on daily basis
* Ps. even tho i started as cookbook, i realized it a bit to complicated so i change it to somehting more simpler = mom's micro managment
---
## User goals
---
### As for user goals, it quite similar to the owners one!
   * to have better control over you own time and entire family
   * more happiness less stressing
   * more free time and beter organization on using this managment system
   * the ability to log all family members to MMM, and hence simpler control of all tasks of all members  
   * each member can make their own acc and add their own tasks to be done

## **Structure of the website**
---
The task managment MMM is designed to be minimalistictic, with cleans and simple outlook. 
Inuitive and easy to understand.

## **Wireframes**
---
* I used website [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/ob6oIW) to create a wireframes, with addition of Photoshop ofc.

  #### I'm never on same page with accessibility vote, as artist and industrial designer i 
  do some things on purpose: for visual apealing or becouse of complementary contrast;
  even though i agree that i didnt do nothing specila with visual effects, but less it always more.
